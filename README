As of 2025, I am a middle-schooler. I have been coding since the age of 5 years old. I've written code in tons of languages like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, Scratch, etc. I have also worked with libraries in Python like Pygame. 
Tons of cool projects have been created with the help of my coding prowess and knowledge. If you are interested in any of them, it is at the bottom of this div. 

Over the 4th grade I took a break from coding and used my time for other things, like learning more science and math.
I used to use repl.it for my projects, but then they changed the way their service works, and it was a lot harder to use it for free. Basically, they made it 
so that if you didn't own a subscription, you could only own 3 repls. At the time I owned 48. So, now I use VS Code as my programming software.


If you're interested in any of my projects, you can check my Youtube channel, where I regularly post some creations I made: https://youtube.com/@PraneelSrinivasan

I have also been writing Scratch code since 1st grade, so I have a ton of projects! Some of them weren't mine, since I wanted to create my own version and experience of that game for myself and some friends. However, I have made a lot of very fun
and impressive programs. If you're interested in my Scratch projects, you can check each and every single one of them here!: https://scratch.mit.edu/users/br8blue/
