As of 2024, I am a middle-schooler. I have been coding since the age of 7 years old. I've written code in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, and Scratch, but I intend on learning
a lot more! Over the 4th grade I took a break from coding and used my time for othing things, like learning more science and math.
I used to use repl.it for my projects, but then they changed the way their service works and it was a lot harder to use it for free. Basically, they made it 
so that if you didn't own a subscription you could only own 3 repls. At the time I owned 48. So, now I use VS Code as my programming software. If you're interested in any of my 
projects, you can check my Youtube channel, where I regularly post some creations I made: https://youtube.com/@PraneelSrinivasan

I may not post ALL my projects, so if you want, check out my Scratch account too!: https://scratch.mit.edu/users/br8blue/
